# <QuizChallenge>

## Description

I was to make a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.
  
When I click the start button, then a timer starts and I am presented with a question.
  
When I answer a question, then I am presented with another question.
  
When I answer a question incorrectly, then time is subtracted from the clock.
  
When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over.
  
When the game is over, then I can save my initials and score.
