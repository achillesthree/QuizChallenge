## Features

Since we were "only" refactoring, I didn't add any features. That said, I was charged with using Semantic HTML Elements to help clean up existing code and to that end I added these tags: header, body, section, figure, main, article, and nav tags. I also added alt attributes to specifiy an alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed.
